### CPSC 120
  Lab 1

  Lab 1 is a favorite of mine mainly because it taught me how to start coding in C++ language using Linux. I learned how to clone git repositories and use terminal commands. While also using the PAT we had made I learned how to input it. Editing code in VS code was something new to me and I enjoyed learning and asking questions. Editing in AUTHORS.md was really interesting and I liked how it contains your name, username, and email. Learning all these aspects in Lab 1 really helped me in future labs that I did later on. 

  Lab 3

  Lab 3, is another favorite of mine because it challenged me to ask questions and take notes on certain aspects I had questions on. I see lab 3 as a stepping stone for the many things I learned in both lecture and lab. Not only that but Lab 3 allowed me to meet people in the lab and pair up with a partner. In lab 3, we learned how to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This interested me because I used to do wrestling for a bit and it’s a sport where you are constantly checking your BMR. We learned how to compile, lint, and use proper formatting.

  Lab 7

  Lab 7, although this lab was a bit difficult I think it earns a spot on my list. I remember sitting with my lab partner confused on parking times and struggling with make format and linting. Asking questions and frustrated wondering what was going wrong. Just to find out that we had typed the time in wrong 7:00 instead of 6:59. Something so little in the code can make the lint and formatting go wrong, although it was frustrating it reminded me to pay attention to those small details. I remember I took a CPSC class my junior year for about a month before I moved and my teacher instilled in the class to ask a rubber duck the question before asking others. His reason for this was that you already know the answer; you just need to repeat it out loud to hear where the code went wrong. I can’t count the amount of times I heard my friends in the lab ask a question and stop midway through and say, “Nevermind I know now.”
